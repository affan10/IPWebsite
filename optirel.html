Esomeparazole (OPTIREL) is the S-isomer of omeprazole, whichinhibits the gastric acid secretion more effectively than omeprazole, which inhibits the gastric acid secretion more effectively than omeprazole. Chemically Esomeprazole is bis(5-methoxy-2-[(S)]-[4-methoxy-3, 5-dimethyl-2-pyridinyl)methyl] suifinyl]-1h- benzimidazole-1-yl) magnesium trihydrate.

                <p>
                  PEAK PLASMA LEVELS OF ESOMEPRAZOLE (OPTIREL) are achieved approximately after 1.5 hour of oral administration. At repeated once daily dosing with 40mg. the systemic bio-availability in approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose of 40mg. Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochome P450 (CYP)enzyme system. The metabolites of Esomeprazole lack anti-secretory activity. The plasma elimination half life of Esomeprazole is approximately 1 to 1.5 hour less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine approximately 80% of oral dose of Essomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine and the

            <h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h2>
            <p>
                OPTIREL (Esomeprazole) is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation or to substituted benzimidazoles.
            </p>
        
        <h2>POSSIBLE ADVERSE EFFECTS </h2>
            <p>

                The most frequently occurring adverse effects with OPTIREL (Esomeprazole) therapy include, diarrhea, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation and dry mouth. Other side effects include Cardiovascular: Hypertension & tachycardia Gastrointestinal: Stomatitis and gastrointestinal candidiasis. Nervous System/Psychiatric: Confusion, depression, dizziness, nervousness, insomnia, parenthesis, somnolence, vertigo, agitation, aggression & hallucination. Endocrine: Gynaecomastia. Hematologic Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis & pancytopenia. Hepatic: increased liver enzymes, hepatitis with or without jaundice & hepatic failure. Dermatologic: Rash, photosensitivity, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).

        </p>
        
        <h2>DRUG INTERACTIONS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Co-administration of Esomeprazole decreases the absorption of ketoconazole & intraconazole due to decreased intragastric acidity during treatment with esomeprazole.
            </li>
            <li>
                Co-administration of Esomeprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has resulted in increases in the levels of esomeprazole and 14 hydroxyclarithromycin.
            </li>
            <li>
            Esomeprazole may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major esomeprazole metabolizing enzyme, so co-administration of esomeprazole with other drugs metabolized by CYP2C19 enzyme such as diazepam, citalopram, imipramine clomipramine, phenytoin, etc., results in increase plasma concentration of these drugs & needs reduction of such drugs.
            </li>

                <p>
                    Use in pregnancy: there are no well-controlled and adequate studies in pregnant women. Esomeprazole should be used during pregnancy, only if clearly needed Use in Lactation: Esomeprazole is likely to be excreted in human milk, so Esomeprazole should be used only if clearly needed. Pediatric Use: Safety & effectiveness of the drug has not been established in pediatric patients. Use in Elderly: No dosage adjustment required in elderly patients. Use in Renal Failure: In cases of severe renal failure the drug should be used with caution.
